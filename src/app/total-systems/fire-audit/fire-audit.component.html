          Fire audits are thorough evaluations of a building's fire safety
          measures, conducted to ensure compliance with fire safety regulations
          and to identify potential risks. These audits involve a detailed
          inspection of all fire protection systems, such as fire alarms,
          sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers, and emergency exits. The
          purpose of a fire audit is to assess the effectiveness of existing
          fire safety protocols, recommend improvements, and ensure that the
          facility meets all legal and safety requirements. By conducting
          regular fire audits, organizations can enhance their fire safety
          preparedness and minimize the risk of fire-related incidents.

          The fire audit process typically includes an initial consultation to
          understand the facility's specific needs and regulatory requirements.
          This is followed by a comprehensive on-site inspection, during which
          fire safety professionals examine all fire protection systems, review
          maintenance records, and assess the building's overall fire safety
          strategy. The audit also involves interviews with key personnel to
          evaluate their knowledge of fire safety procedures. After the
          inspection, a detailed report is provided, outlining findings,
          compliance gaps, and recommended actions to improve fire safety.
          Follow-up audits may be scheduled to ensure that recommended measures
          are implemented effectively.
